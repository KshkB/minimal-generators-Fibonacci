# Minimal Fibonacci Generators

## Problem statement

Given an integer $N, N> 0$ what is the minimal, positive integer pair $(i, j)$ such that the Fibonacci sequence generated by $(i, j)$ contains $N$?

**Note.** Tuples (here, integral 2-vectors) are ordered by their Euclidean length. That is, treat $(i, j)$ as lengths of legs of a right-angle triangle. The *Euclidean length* of the tuple $(i, j)$ is then $\|(i, j)\| = \sqrt{i^2 + j^2}$. Accordingly, the ordering on tuples is given by: 

$$(i, j) \leq (i^\prime, j^\prime)\iff\|(i, j)\| \leq \|(i^\prime, j^\prime)\|.$$

## Repository description

In this repository find a python script, `fibonacci_minimal_generator.py`, and executable notebook `ntbk.ipynb`. Modify and run the code cells in `ntbk` as desired to obtain minimal Fibonacci generators for a given $N$.
